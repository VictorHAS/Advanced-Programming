# Repository for solving exercises in the Advanced Programming discipline.

## Each folder refers to a question that's in the pdf [List](listaponteiros.pdf)

Since the pdf list is in Portuguese, I'll create a list below with the translated questions;

- [x] 1. Find the value of the following expressions
```c
int i=3,j=5;
int *p, *q;
p = &i;
q = &j;

p == &i; // ?
*p - *q; // ?
**&p; // ?
3 - *p/(*q) + 7; // ?
```
